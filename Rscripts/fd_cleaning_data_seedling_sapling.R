# this script is essentially an ingestion script for the raw seedling and sapling 
# data. The ruler used for measuring stem height had a half cm space before tick marks
# began, thus requiring all stems measured with the ruler to have an additional 0.5cm
# added to their height. The criteria for these stems were >0 but =<30 cm height.

# In the bottom half of this script, I take the seedling_sapling_2019.csv and change
# the format to match the 2020 data. the 2019 data did not need the 0.5cm adjustment.
